Check the NodePort Service Configuration:
------------------------------------------
Ensure that the NodePort service is properly configured and pointing to the correct port of the replica set.
kubectl get svc <service-name> -o yaml

Verify ReplicaSet and Pod Status:
-------------------------------------
Ensure that the ReplicaSet is correctly managing the desired number of pods and that the pods are running.
kubectl get rs <replicaset-name> 
kubectl get pods -l app=<app-label>


Check Pod Logs:
-----------------------------
Review the logs of the application pods to ensure that the application is starting up correctly and listening on the expected port.
kubectl logs <pod-name>

Verify Pod Connectivity:
---------------------------------
Check if the application is reachable within the cluster using port forwarding.
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 8000:8000
 
Access the application locally at http://localhost:8000.


Ensure NodePort Accessibility:
---------------------------------
Ensure that the NodePort range is open and accessible on the cluster nodes(30000-32767)


Check NodePort Assignment:
---------------------------------
Verify that the NodePort service has been assigned a port within the correct range and is accessible externally.
kubectl describe svc <service-name>

Test NodePort Access:
----------------------------------
Attempt to access the application using the Node IP and NodePort.
http://NodeIP:NodePort.
