A typical scenario where a DaemonSet is preferred over a ReplicaSet is when deploying a system monitoring agent across all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
A system monitoring agent, like Prometheus Node Exporter, needs to be deployed on every node to collect essential metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and network activity from each individual node. A DaemonSet is specifically designed to ensure that a pod runs on every node in the cluster, providing comprehensive monitoring coverage. ReplicaSet, on the other hand, does not provide the node-specific deployment guarantees and is thus not suitable for this use case.
